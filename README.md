# intend.utils.js
intend.utils.js was created with the intent of providing a generic way to communicate between JavaScript components through a loose coupling by expressing and registering intents.

## Release Notes - 0.1.0-ALPHA
### This is the first version committed to GitHub. This initial version supports registering and expressing intents with some basic wildcard matching capability. At this point, while a large amount of unit tests are provided, not all pieces have been properly tested in multiple browsers and optimiations have not yet been performed.

The goal of the next several releases is to get the correct functionality down, along with appropriate unit tests, so that before 1.0.0-GA is ready optimizations and bug fixes can occur.
